# 👋🏽 Hey, I'm Awonke Mnotoza! 🌱
![Banner Image](https://i.ibb.co/w4z4dQB/Linked-In-banner.png)
Welcome to my cozy corner of the coding universe! 🚀 As a self-taught full stack developer and a curious student, I'm always tinkering with code, exploring new technologies, and sipping on a cup of virtual juice (I don't drink coffee). ☕

## About Me

- **Nature Lover**: When I'm not debugging, you'll find me hiking through digital forests or chasing pixelated sunsets. 🌿🌄
- **Introverted Coder**: I thrive in the quiet hum of my IDE, where curly braces are my best friends. 🤓
- **Content Creator**: I share my experiences into blogs and YouTube videos. [Join me](https://contawo.com/) on this journey! 📝🎥

## Tech Stack 🛠️

- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, TypeScript and Streamlit
  ```ts
  function greet(username: string) : string {
    return "Hello " + username;
  }
  ```
- **Backend**: Python, Node.js and Springboot
  ```py
  def greet(username: str) -> str:
    return f"Hello {username}"
  ```
- **Databases**: Firebase, MonogoDB and MySQL
- **Frameworks**: React and NextJS
  ```ts
  import React from "react"

  export default Greet({username} : {username: string}) {
    return (
      <p>Hello {username}</p>
    )
  }
  ```
- **Version Control**: Git (because branches are like parallel universes, right?)

## What You'll Find Here
- **Projects**: From simple scripts to full-blown web apps.
- **Tutorials**: Step-by-step guides for fellow explorers.
